## Exercise 1

Running perf on a *Haswell Intel® Core™ i7-4770 CPU @ 3.40GHz × 8*/ Operating System: *Linux Ubuntu*


    sudo perf stat -a -e "power/energy-cores/" /bin/ls

    >> performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    >>
    >> 0,00 Joules power/energy-cores/
    >>
    >> 0,000745074 seconds time elapsed

    sudo perf stat -a -e "power/energy-cores/" /bin/mkdir test

    >> performance counter stats for 'system wide':
    >>
    >> 0,01 Joules power/energy-cores/
    >>
    >> 0,000770920 seconds time elapsed

> The power/energy-cores/ perf counter is based on an MSR register called MSR_PP0_ENERGY_STATUS, which is part of the Intel RAPL interface. RAPL is a powerful tool to not only measure, but also limit power supply.
>
> PP0 refers to *power plane 0*, a RAPL domain containing all cores of the socket and private caches of cores. Not included is the last-level cache, the interconnect, memory controller, the GPU and other auxiliary components not directly being part of the core. Apparently there is no possibility to measure PP0 in any other way, which makes it difficult to say something about the accurancy.
>
> It is possible to measure other RAPL domains like the Package, DRAM and PSys domains.
