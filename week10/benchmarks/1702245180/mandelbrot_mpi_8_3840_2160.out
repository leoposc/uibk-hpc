By default, for Open MPI 4.0 and later, infiniband ports on a device
are not used by default.  The intent is to use UCX for these devices.
You can override this policy by setting the btl_openib_allow_ib MCA parameter
to true.

WARNING: There was an error initializing an OpenFabrics device.

WARNING: There is at least non-excluded one OpenFabrics device found,
but there are no active ports detected (or Open MPI was unable to use
them).  This is most certainly not what you wanted.  Check your
cables, subnet manager configuration, etc.  The openib BTL will be
ignored for this job.
